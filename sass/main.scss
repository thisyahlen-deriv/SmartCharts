/*
 Edit (and rename) this file to implement your own style. Please avoid editing the imported _ciq...scss files
 other than _ciq_general.scss so that you can receive upgrades without having to reimplement your changes.
 Instead, override any styles from within this file, or substitute the includes with your own.

 _ciq-general.scss contains generalized css that affects the entire page. This is necessary
 for the sample project but may not be required for your application.

 _ciq-components.scss contains the main styles for the ChartIQ component library. Set your
 theme colors, fonts, etc in this file.

_ciq-night.scss contains css overrides for a night (dark) theme. Use this as a template
for building additional themes.

 _ciq-extras.scss includes styling for ChartIQ plugins. You may not require this at all.

 Run sass to generate a css file from this file and the included _ciq files. Include that css
 in your html.
